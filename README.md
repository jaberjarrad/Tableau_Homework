Phenomena # 1 and based on my Dataset 01/2018. Total Number of participants was 841,201, of that 637,589 were Female participants and the rest were Male participant.

Phenomena # 2 participants who were born in the 1950 - 1960 do have the highest percentages among other age and birth year groups, no sure why, but I found it very interesting.
